## Trees

Trees are non linear data structures which follow hierarchal structure. Like linked lists, there are nodes and each nodes here are connected by parent-child relationship (unlike linked lists). The node which is higher in the hierarchy is the parent node and node which is connected to the parent node but is lower in the hierarchy is the child node. Now there are various terms which are used in the context trees, some of which we will try to understand:

- **Leaf node :** The nodes which do not have any child of their own are leaf nodes
- **Ancestors :** Ancestor of a node(X) is the node from which, if traversed down in the hierarchy, we can reach X
- **Binary Tree :** The binary tree is a tree in which each node has atmost two child nodes
- **Full Binary Tree :** The full binary tree is a tree in which node has exactly child nodes except the leaf nodes
- **Complete Binary Tree :** The complete binary tree  is a tree in which all levels are completely filled except possible the last level

### Representation of a tree

There are various ways by which we can represent trees. One of the best ways to represent, which I find very convenient is using vector of vectors in C++. How this is handy? Its because here parent child relationship can be expressed very easily. Here mostly we will deal with Binary Trees. This is the representation:

```
    vector<int> trees[10000];
```
The above denotes the 10000 nodes trees. How to store the parent-child relationship? We will see this by an simple example:

Now how to represent above binary tree using the above mentioned notation:

```
    vector<int> tree[10];
    // for node 1
    tree(1).push_back(2);
    tree(1).push_back(3);
    // for node 2
    tree(2).push_back(4);
    tree(2).push_back(5);
    // for node 3
    tree(3).push_back(6);
    tree(3).push_back(7);
```

### Tree traversal

Coming to our next problem. Given a tree (Binary tree or not), how to traverse the tree? So there are mostly two mechanism by which we traverse a tree, namely - Depth First Search, Breadth First Search. We will discuss both of them in detail here.

### Depth First Search

Depth first tree is traversal mechanism by which we go in depth first and then width wise. At each encounter of a node, we go to its child and then its child and so on. After we reach a leaf node then we move to another child of the current parent. Its a bit confusing, lets see the pseudo code:

```
    dfs(int node) {
        print (node);
        // call dfs() on the child of the node
        for (on all child of the node) {
            dfs(child);
        }
    }
```

#### Time Complexity

Say there are V vertices/nodes in the tree and E edges in the tree. So here we are going over each node and for each node we go over the each edge of the tree. Note that each edge or vertex is visited exactly once. So overall time complexity comes out to ```O(V+E)```.

### Breadth First Search

Breadth first search is what we call level order traversal of the tree. First we go breadth wise i.e. we go to all children of a node and then go to a child and then to its all children and so on. Lets see the pseudo code:

```
    // we will use a queue to implement BFS
    queue<int> Q;
    //push the root node to queue
    Q.push(root);
    bfs() {
        while(Q is not empty) {
            parent = Q.front();
            Q.pop();
            print(parent);
            for (on all child of parent) {
                Q.push(child);
            }
        }
    }
```

[BFS C++ code](https://github.com/dummybyte/CodeBlog/blob/master/BFS.cpp)

#### Time Complexity
Like DFS, here also we traverse each vertex and each edge exactly once. So the time complexity comes out to be ```O(V+E)```.
