## Hello World!!!

This is an attempt to create some content on Data Structures and Algorithms. Here we are going to discuss some problems on various data structures.

Why this initiative, when there is already a lot of content on the web?

I have started this only to solve those issues which I faced during my college days. There are many good contents on the web but there are still some basic questions which I didn't find answers any where on the web. This is an attempt to answer those queries. I need all your support in doing so.
